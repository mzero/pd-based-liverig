patch tasks




== Config ==
    [ ] redo dt-port and uc-port things
        - should be abstractions so port assignments can be edited
        - should be used on 8 slider sub-patch to calculate channel numbers

== Link ==
    [x] test accuracy of link sync
    [x] sync to the "1" with a start command
        - on "request" from a control
        - since MIDI Start causes DT to reset
        - the conditional measure count
    [x] improve accuracy of displayed tempo on UC44
    [ ] send quantum change on edit? possible?

== Audio Chain ==
    [ ] looper / stutter
        [-] set display properties to show one bar?
            - can't work: buffer draw doesn't clip, and lags DSP when changed!
        [x] check that stutters are at right place
        [x] quantum/beat from link section rather than built in
        [x] lengthen buffers
        [x] whole bar loop button
        [x] fade rate

        [ ] inv. fader on input
        [ ] extras
            [ ] slow/stop time
            [ ] reverse?

    [ ] multi-band compressor / saturation
    [x] eq 3
        [ ] move to end?
    [x] multi-delay
        [ ] missing filters?
    [ ] - try openair~ convoultion reverb
    [ ] ?? how to route between verb and belay?

== MISC ===
    [x] "Sane" toggles for each section
        [ ] ? then have reset bang trigger those
        [x] name silders send 'em values

>>  [ ] send initial value to MIDI controls
        [ ] a few ms after resetbang?

    [ ] zippering on hp/lp filter controls

== Controls ==
>>  [ ] reset button & re-send controls button
    [ ] encoder button should be a note that causes a reset
        - esp. for eq3 controls
        - esp. for reverb controls
    [ ] sync start should be a button, not a control
    [ ] consider using quantize display format for beat based controls
        - flutter
        - delay length

== Digitakt ==
    [ ] mutes? worth trying to get to work?
        - unmute on reset?
    [ ] listen for patch change from DT
        - then resend all volume faders
