[ ] PreenFM2
    [x] how to control volume?
        [x] CC_FILTER_GAIN, 73
            -- controls gain of filter or final mix in all modes!
    [x] other CCs?
        [-] modwheel = 1
        [-] carrier attack, release = 80 & 81
            -- nice idea, but destroys patch, not mods, so better to do this
                via the mod matrix
        [x] performance params: 115..118
        [-] mod matrix multipliers: 46..49
        [-] filter parameters: 71, 72

    [x] power? USB to Pi? USB to power? Power Adapter?
        - USB to Pi
    [ ] three patches
        [ ] bass
        [ ] pad
        [ ] plucky

[ ] convolution reverb
    [ ] choose from several fixed choices
    [ ] other controls?

[ ] timers
    [ ] total timer
    [ ] segment timer
    [ ] display: two segments, direct mode
    [ ] left encoder push: reset (if stopped)
    [ ] right encoder push: start / stop

[ ] send initial value to MIDI controls
    [ ] a few ms after resetbang?
    [ ] a button to request this send
    [ ] debug why at start up not all "right"

[ ] review looper

[ ] display only controls
    - should ignore encoder changes
    [ ] set encoder min/max to 0?
    [ ] patch control to resend current value?
    [ ] link participant count
    [ ] GO button
    [ ] timers

[ ] beat quantized controls
    - display in FF quant. format
    [ ] loop fade
    [ ] flutter

[ ] eq controls should be bipolar

[ ] button control issues
    [ ] faderfox is sending 0/1, but pd is sending 0/127 to set led
    [ ] buttons fire on both down and up
        -- buttons control local display, so up turns off (when not in toggle)
        [ ] either activate, send on up for such controls
        [ ] -or- disable FF local control of LED?



LATERS

== Config ==
    [ ] redo dt-port and uc-port things
        - should be abstractions so port assignments can be edited
        - should be used on 8 slider sub-patch to calculate channel numbers

== Link ==
    [ ] send quantum change on edit? possible?

== Audio Chain ==
    [ ] looper / stutter
        [ ] extras
            [ ] slow/stop time
            [ ] reverse?

    [ ] multi-band compressor / saturation
    [ ] move eq2 to end?
        [ ] belay: filters in feedback?
    [ ] - try openair~ convoultion reverb
    [ ] ?? how to route between verb and belay?

== MISC ===
    [ ] zippering on hp/lp filter controls

== Controls ==
    [ ] encoder button should be a note that causes a reset
        - esp. for eq3 controls
        - esp. for reverb controls


== Digitakt ==
    [ ] unsolo ALL!!!!!
    [ ] mutes? worth trying to get to work?
        - unmute on reset?
    [ ] listen for patch change from DT
