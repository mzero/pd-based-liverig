patch tasks




[ ] PreenFM2
    [x] how to control volume?
        [x] CC_FILTER_GAIN, 73
            -- controls gain of filter or final mix in all modes!
    [ ] volume encoders (!)
        [ ] route direct or via DT?
    [ ] other CCs?
        [ ] modwheel = 1
        [ ] carrier attack, release = 80 & 81
            -- nice idea, but destroys patch, not mods, so better to do this
                via the mod matrix
        [ ] carrier release = 81
        [ ] performance params: 115..118
        [ ] mod matrix multipliers: 46..49
        [ ] filter parameters: 71, 72


    [ ] power? USB to Pi? USB to power? Power Adapter?
    [ ] three patches
        [ ] bass
        [ ] pad
        [ ] plucky
    [ ] keyboard router
        [ ] add third selector



[ ] timers
    [ ] total timer
    [ ] segment timer
    [ ] display: two segments, direct mode
    [ ] left encoder push: reset (if stopped)
    [ ] right encoder push: start / stop

[ ] convolution reverb
    [ ] choose from several fixed choices
    [ ] other controls?

[ ] send initial value to MIDI controls
    [ ] a few ms after resetbang?
    [ ] a button to request this send
    [ ] debug why at start up not all "right"

[ ] volume of preenFM2 instruments
    [ ] 2? 4?
    [ ] faders? encoders?

[ ] review looper






LATERS

== Config ==
    [ ] redo dt-port and uc-port things
        - should be abstractions so port assignments can be edited
        - should be used on 8 slider sub-patch to calculate channel numbers

== Link ==
    [ ] send quantum change on edit? possible?

== Audio Chain ==
    [ ] looper / stutter
        [ ] extras
            [ ] slow/stop time
            [ ] reverse?

    [ ] multi-band compressor / saturation
    [ ] move eq2 to end?
        [ ] belay: filters in feedback?
    [ ] - try openair~ convoultion reverb
    [ ] ?? how to route between verb and belay?

== MISC ===
    [ ] zippering on hp/lp filter controls

== Controls ==
    [ ] move looper & BPM controls together
    [ ] encoder button should be a note that causes a reset
        - esp. for eq3 controls
        - esp. for reverb controls
    [ ] sync start should be a button, not a control
    [ ] consider using quantize display format for beat based controls
        - flutter
        - delay length

    [ ] various quantized controls should display quantized indicators
        - for these, the UC44 needs to be set for display ext. only
        - and there will be distinct display vs. input busses

== Digitakt ==
    [ ] unsolo ALL!!!!!
    [ ] mutes? worth trying to get to work?
        - unmute on reset?
    [ ] listen for patch change from DT
        - then resend all volume faders
